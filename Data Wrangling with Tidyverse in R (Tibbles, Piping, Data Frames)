Purpose of data wrangling 
a. Spot, reshape and derive variables. 
b. Join multiple data sets together for easier use 

Two main packages -> dplyr, tidyverse

TBL/Tibble - better way to look at large datasets based on RStudio limitations 
tbl_df(diamonds)
Tibbles generally do less than normal built-in R dataframes 

View Fuction - look at entire dataset, opens up a new window above similar to an Excel file (usually in top left of RStudio window)

Pipe operation - feeds previous dataframe into next statement 
Comes from magrittr (call this) but imported from dplyr. Allows us to "pipe" in the first operator of SELECT
diamonds$x %>% mean()
As chains get longer, better to use this to continue your code. Better for short, linear and interchangable lines of code that require some repetition. 

Dplyr - faster and easier to read for wrangling thatn Base R 
Five main dplyr verbs 
- Mutate 
- Filter
- Arrange
- Select 
- Summarize 

Example using Titanic dataset 
data = data.frame(Titanic)
Ex: find raw number of passengers 
num_pass = summarise(data, num_pass=sum(Freq))

Group By 
Ex: Numbers of passengers by class? 
num_pass_by_class = data %>% 
+ group_by(data$Class) %>% 
+ summarise(num_pass=sum(Freq))
