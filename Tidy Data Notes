Tidyverse concept 
Each variable must have its own column.
Each observation must have its own row.
Each value must have its own cell.
- Most built-in R functions work in "tidy" forms of vectorized data 
Pivot Longer 
- Needed when column names are not structured, but names of variables 
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
  
Pivot Wider - needed when an observation is scattered across multiple rows (one to many relationship in a file down rows, similar to MSD data exports from work). 
table2 %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
