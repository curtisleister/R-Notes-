What is the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency? MPG dataset
ggplot2::mpg

##Put engine size on x axis and mpg on y axis 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
  
First argument of ggplot() is always data, which just creates an empty graph. Need to add layers to make it insightful. 
geom_point() = start of the scatterplot 
geom_point takes a "mapping" argument first, followed by "aes" to pull in variables for x and y axis. 

Add a third dimension to a scatterplot by mapping to an aes() function
Creates a visual property/legend to the points on the plot (size/shape/color) 
-Ex: map a variable to color. Ggplot automatically "scales" an appropriate color to each variable
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
  
 Different Aesthetics 
 Color - self-explanatory 
 Size - self-explanatory (not always advised) 
 
 ##Alpha - shade/gradient 
 ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))
 Shape - Adds a different shape (ggpplot only uses six shapes max)
 
Possible to set an entire color code for your plot aesthetic by mapping the aes function outside of parenthesis, where the aesthetic variable is set
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
  
Categorical R variables == discrete in Tableau, convey non-numeric values. Class is a categorical variable in the dataset.  
Continuous == continuous in tableau, convey metrics. MPG is a continuous variable in the dataset. 

Facets - Wraps are subplots that show different frames of the data. Helps for smaller datasets where you can plot continuous data without too much stuff getting cluttered, helps segment out data. Probably not feasible for huge datasets. 
First argument is to start a formula "~" followed by a discrete variable. 

Facet grids are plotting two variables, require two discrete 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
  
Geoms - change displays of the data. 
ex: geom_smooth adds in a line. Can't change the shape of a line, but we can change the line type. 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
  

##"Group" or "Color" aesthetic - adds multiple objects into the line, or adds a color variable to the group
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))
  
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv),
    show.legend = FALSE
  )
  
##Add in multiple geom() commands into the same plot. Good idea to run mapping first to set global varibales for both geom functions, but you can run individual mapping to customize each line/plot. 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
  
- Setting the SE argument in geom_smooth() sets a confidence interval around the line being drawn 

1 - First graph code recreation -> scatterplot with a line graph, larger plot marks and line thickness
ggplot() + geom_point(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy), size = 4) + geom_smooth( data = mpg, aes(x=displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"), se = FALSE, color = "blue", size = 2)

2 - Second graph code recreation -> same scatterplot with multiple lines displaying the drivetrain group 
ggplot() + geom_point(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy), size = 4) + geom_smooth( data = mpg, aes(x=displ, y = hwy, color = "blue", group = drv), se = FALSE, color = "blue", size = 2)

3 - Third graph code recreation -> scatterplot with grouped multiple lines showing drivetrain, all colored by drivetrain 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
         geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv), size = 2) + 
       geom_smooth(mapping = aes(color = drv, group = drv), size = 2)
       
4 - Fourth graph code recreation -> scatterplot with grouped multiple lines of different type, same color. 

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
                      geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv), size = 4) + 
                      geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv), size = 2,  se = FALSE)
                      
Bar Charts in R 

geom_bar() function 

Bar charts auto-calculate new values from data (aka count, frequency, etc.)
