What is the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency? MPG dataset
ggplot2::mpg

##Put engine size on x axis and mpg on y axis 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
  
First argument of ggplot() is always data, which just creates an empty graph. Need to add layers to make it insightful. 
geom_point() = start of the scatterplot 
geom_point takes a "mapping" argument first, followed by "aes" to pull in variables for x and y axis.
